## Description

The purpose of "Zoosta" is to give users a genuine unbiased review along with an "insiders" guide to hidden gems other users may have discovered on a vacation to a foreign city, and for a user to upload memories via photos or a blog themselves related to their get-away adventure. zoosta provides an opportunity to reflect on your experiences, remember them in more detail, and share them with others who may not have been able to join you on your trip.

## Installation

Users will only need to click the deployable link. A programmer must clone this repository from GitHub and download MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, and JWT Auth.

## Usage

Upon rendering the Heroku link, users can choose between logging in or creating an account via the sign-up button. Once the user creates their account, the page will react to the press of the button, and it will prompt you to provide your login credentials. Once signed in, you will see a feed page. Here, you will see trending posts and a search bar at the top to search a specific area. Users can click in the top corners, generate posts, and view profile information.
